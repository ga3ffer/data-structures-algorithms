- Invoking the program

Run the program with a command line argument, textfile that consist a list of names, sorted or unsorted.
The file does not contain any delimiters, only a string and a newline character.

If no arguments are specified, the program will quit.

If more than one argument is specified, the program will quit.

If the path of the file does not exist, the program will quit.


- Using command line

Once the file is successfully read, all the names will be read into an ArrayList<String> as  strings.
The command line will look something like this: 

----------Command Line----------

OPTIONS:
Execute one of these methods on all sets:
* insert
* search
* predecessor
* successor
* minimum
* maximum
* delete
Time all methods (except delete):
* runtest
To exit/quit program:
* quit


Available commands are: runtest, insert, search, delete, predecessor, successor, minimum, maximum, and quit.

runtest will preform insertion, search (using 10 random generated keys), predecessor, successor,
minimum, and maximum, on all four data structures, while timing their runtime using  System.nanoTime(), and then printing the results in a table.					
 
insert, search, delete, predecessor, and successor require a key to be submitted, so the driver class can 
preform the specified operation.

NOTE: 
Certain commands that prompt the user for a key to preform a search are Case-sensitive, and must be extended by an extra whitespace ' ', since the test files this program used contain an extra whitespace after each name.

- Error Messages

Error Code: 1100 -> results from typing a non-existent command

Error Code: 0100 -> results from trying to insert a key already in the set

Error Code: 0010 -> results from trying to preform an operation on a key thats non-existent in the  set

Error Code: 0000 -> results from trying to preform a min or max operation on an empty set

Error Code: 1111 -> the default error code when the program is not started correctly
