- Overview

This program includes a graph implementation of directed edges.

The main program "Main" will open a given Netdraw .VNA file (given as
a command line argument) and print some details about it concerning the number of vertex and arc, graph density, vertex degree distribution and the strongly connected components found in the graph.   


For compiling and operating instructions refer to index.html or Operations Manual.html
located in the _Dcumentation_and_Testing folder
