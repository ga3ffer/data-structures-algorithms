- Overview

This program includes a graph implementation of directed edges.

The main program "Driver" will open a given Netdraw .VNA file (given when asked for in program) and print some details 
about it concerning the number of vertex and arc, graph density, vertex degree distribution, 
the strongly connected components, and network metrics including graph reciprocity, degree correlation and the
clustering coefficient found in the graph.   


For compiling and operating instructions refer to index.html or Operations Manual.html
located in the _Dcumentation_and_Testing folder
